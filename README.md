1. Write Python code to print the following shape
    ```
    *****
    ****
    ***
    **
    *
    ```

2. Write a Python code to do the following

    - Create a variable `friend_name` that has your friend’s name
    - Create a variable `friend_age` that has your friend’s age
    - Create a variable `friend_later_age` that has your friend’s age in 10 years
    - Print the following
      ```
      Hi, friend_name. In 10 years, you will be friend_later_age years old
      ```

3. An area of triangle is defined as the following

    ```
    Area = 1/2 x (base x height)
    ```

    Write Python code to calculate an area of triangle with base = 10 and height = 10

4. A factorial of a positive number N is defined as the multiplication of all positive numbers less than or equal to N.

    For example:
    ```
    factorial of 6 will be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 = 720
    Factorial of 10 will be 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9 * 10 = 362880
    ```

    Write a Python code to calculate the factorial of 15

5. A volume of a sphere is defined as `4/3 x π x r3` , where `π = 3.14` and r is the radius of the sphere. Write Python code to calculate the volume of a sphere with radius = 10

6. Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the formula to calculate the slope of these two lines is defined as the following
    ```
    slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
    ```

    Write Python code to calculate the slope of points (1, 2) and (4, 5). Note that you will need to use five variables (x1, y1, x2, y2, and slope)  

7. Write a Python code to swap two numbers by using temporary variable

8. Write a Python code to swap two numbers without using temporary variable (hint: use addition and subtraction operations)

9. A positive number is an even number if it can be divided evenly by 2 (no remainder). How will you use the Python modulo (%) operator to determine whether a number is an even or odd number? Once you figure that out, determine whether the following numbers are even or odd
    - 1048576
    - 1073741823
    - 0
